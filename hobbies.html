<h1>Oh, hey.</h1>
<p>I forgot to mention some of my hobbies. I love reptiles, snakes, and pretty much anything that is slimy and green. I'm also really bad with people but I didn't want to put that on my main page because it seems like a really bad thing to have on your resume. 
<p>So, ummm.. can I have $20? I promise I'll give it back. Like tomorrow.</p>
